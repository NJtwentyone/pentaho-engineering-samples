# Visualization API Clean Sandbox

This sample contains a minimal sandbox from which sandboxes for specific samples or experiments may be derived.
The sandbox is initially configured to use the `pentaho/visual/samples/calc/Model` visualization â€” 
the only visualization that comes bundled with the Visualization API.

## Installation

1. Install the package dependencies:

```shell
npm install 
```

2. Install the sandbox files:

```shell
npx init-sandbox
```

3. Open `sandbox.html` through a local web-server
   (such as Python's, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`).
